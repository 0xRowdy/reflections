When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

It is a good idea to use a remote repository for multiple reasons. Technology is not 
perfect and your harddrive may fail. If that happens you will lose all of your hard
work coding a new program. When the file is stored on a remote repository you have
the ability to restore it from another machine if yours fails. Additionaly if you
want to work on the project with others they you both have the ability to work on
features indepentently and then merge them together. This is nice if you and your 
co-developers are in different geographic locations.
