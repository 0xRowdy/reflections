When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

It is a good idea to use a remote repository for multiple reasons. Technology is not
perfect and your hard drive may fail. If that happens you will lose all of your hard
work coding a new program. When the file is stored on a remote repository you have
the ability to restore it from another machine if yours fails. Additionaly if you
want to work on the project with others they you both have the ability to work on
features indepentently and then merge them together. This is nice if you and your
co-developers are in different geographic locations.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You want to have control of of what code is stored on your local machine when
working on a project. If pulls automatically happened then code from another
developer could be brought down to your local machine and mess up what you
are working on.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?

Forks are very similar to branches but with a few added features. It exists on
a remote repository like github. This means you have more control over who can
fork you repo or who can issue a request to push data back. Clones are just a
copy of a code base that can be done computer to computer or with a service like
git. Branches are a way to keep seperate features on your local machine and
check them back in once the feature is complete.
