Question 1
When you initialize a repository you need to type git init. This creates the
git file for the different commits or versions to be stored.

Question 2
A staging area is different than a working directory because you have the
ability to see the files you want to add to the main branch.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

The staging area allows users to make a logical change and monitor. Once the
changes have been added to the staging area you are able to commit or back out
of the changes that have been made.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

Branches are helpful if you want to do things that are a potential risk or
could change the functionality of the program. Things like creating an easy
mode or changing the language of the program.
