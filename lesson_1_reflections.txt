Question 1
The ability to view a difference between two files reduces the amount of time
that I would have to spend looking for a bug.
This could provide useful when pushing my code to a repo that then creates a bug
or checking what was changed in others code to further trouble shoot if my
component was working previously.

Question 2
The ability to revert back to a previous version of a program can be incredibly
valuable as a programer. It will allow you to revert back to a functioning
version if your changed break the program.

Question 3
Pros and Cons exist for the ability to create manual commits in git. I believe
that if you are pro-active as a developer you should not run into issues with
having to few commits.

Question 4
I can see the appeal when saving multiple files at the same time in git.  One
may be saving a class that extends to different files in a program or saving the
multiple files that make up a website. If git did not have this feature people
would forget to save one of the files and break their program, causing errors,
time troubleshooting and waisted dev time.

Question 5
with git log you have the ability to search out and find old commits that may
have code that was deleted by mistake. The ability to use git diff can help
you find the specific changes between two commits on the same git repo. This
can be useful when you are looking to bring old code back into an enhansment.

Question 6
With the ability to revert code back to a previous version we don't have to
worry much in the development process. Developers are able to find bugs and
isolate code that may have caused problems or possibly been deleted by mistake.
